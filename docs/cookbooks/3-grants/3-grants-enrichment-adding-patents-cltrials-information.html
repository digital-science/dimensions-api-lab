<p>This tutorial builds on the previous one, <em>Enriching Grants with Publications Information from Dimensions</em>, and it assumes that our grants list already includes Dimensions IDs as well as publications counts for each grant.</p>

<h2>Extracting linked Patents data<a class="headerlink" href="#Extracting-linked-Patents-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using a similar methodology as with publications, we can easily extract all patents linked to each grant in two steps.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>retrieve all the relevant patents records using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">associated_grant_ids</span></code> field (see also the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html">data model</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-patents.html">patents API fields</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>group patents by grant ID in so that we can have a single count per record</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: in this case we can iterate 400 grants at a time cause in general there are much less associated patents per grant (compared to publications).</p>
