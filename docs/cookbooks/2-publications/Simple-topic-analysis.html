<p>The dataset we’ll be using in this tutorial contains publications from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.grid.ac/institutes/grid.17063.33">University of Toronto</a>.</p>
<p>By using the parameters below, we can restrict the dataset further using dates (publications year) and a subject area (field of research code).</p>
<p>After extracting the publications records, we are going to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">as_dataframe_concepts</span></code> method to unpack concepts/scores data into a format that makes it easier to analyse it. For more background, see also the <a class="reference external" href="https://api-lab.dimensions.ai/cookbooks/1-getting-started/7-Working-with-concepts.html">Working with concepts in the Dimensions API</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>Wordclouds are often a pretty effective way of summarising the relative importance of keywords.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud">wordcloud Python library</a> can be used to turn our concepts list into an image. The Wordcloud function takes a list of dictionaries with words/frequency eg</p>

<p>We can build a simple scatter plot using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">freq_growth</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">score_growth</span></code> values just calculated.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MIN_SCORE</span></code> parameter we can filter out concepts with an overall <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">score_avg</span></code> which is too low (note: this value is the average from all years, see section 1 above)</p></li>
<li><p>by mapping <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">score_avg</span></code> to the dots color, we can quickly visually identify concepts with a high score in the graph</p></li>

<h2>7. Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#7.-Conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this tutorial we have demonstrated how to process publication <em>concepts</em> - normalised keywords found in documents- obtained using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/">Dimensions Analytics API</a>.</p>
<p>By playing with parameters like <em>frequency</em> and <em>average score</em>, it is possible to highlight interesting concepts programmatically and use them to carry out semantic analyses of the documents dataset they derive from.</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, see also the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/language.html#searching-using-concepts">official documentation on concepts</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://api-lab.dimensions.ai/cookbooks/1-getting-started/7-Working-with-concepts.html">Working with concepts in the Dimensions API</a> tutorial.</p>
