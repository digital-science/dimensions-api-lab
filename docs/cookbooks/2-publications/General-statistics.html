<p>Most publications have one or more associated Field Of Research (FOR) category, which is represented in the JSON like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&#39;category_for&#39; : [{&#39;id&#39;: &#39;3292&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;1402 Applied Economics&#39;},

                    }`
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However since some publications may not have an associated FOR category, the resulting JSON in some cases may not have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">category_for</span></code> as a key. Since we want to import the data into pandas we need to ensure the key is always there and has an empty list when no category is available.</p>
