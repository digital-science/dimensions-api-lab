<h1>Measuring the policy impact of an organization using policy document citations<a class="headerlink" href="#Measuring-the-policy-impact-of-an-organization-using-policy-document-citations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This notebook shows how to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/">Dimensions Analytics API</a> to analyze the policy impact of an organization.</p>
<p>We will do this by counting the indirect links via publications, <strong>hence it permits to gain some insight into the indirect policy impact of a research organization</strong>. The goal therefore is to extract and inspect policy documents that <em>cite</em> publications from the research organization in question.</p>
<p>Since the various content types included in the Dimensions database are <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html">deeply interlinked</a>, the Dimensions APIs allow to perform this analysis via a few simple steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We start from a <a class="reference external" href="https://grid.ac/">GRID</a> identifier (representing a research organization in Dimensions).</p></li>
<li><p>We use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-publications.html">publications API</a> to extract all publications where at least one author is/was affiliated to the GRID organization, for a selected time period.</p></li>
<li><p>We then use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-policy_documents.html">policy documents API</a> to discover policy documents that include citations to any of those publications.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we analyse the policy documents data to highlight trends.</p></li>

<p>We can use the Fields of Research categories information in publications to obtain a breakdown of the publications by subject area.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by ‘exploding’ the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">category_for</span></code> data into a separate table, since there can be more than one category per publication. The new categories table also retains some basic info about the publications it relates to, e.g. <em>journal</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>publication id</em>, etc., to make it easier to analyse the data.</p>

<h3>Is there a correlation between publication citations and policy document citations?<a class="headerlink" href="#Is-there-a-correlation-between-publication-citations-and-policy-document-citations?" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note: if the points on a scatterplot graph produce a lower-left-to-upper-right pattern (see below), this is indicative of a positive correlation between the two variables. This pattern means that when the score of one observation is high, we expect the score of the other observation to be high as well, and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here<a class="headerlink" href="#Where-to-go-from-here" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/">Dimensions Analytics API</a> tutorial we have seen how, starting from an organization’s GRID ID, it is possible to extract a) publications from authors affiliated with this organization, b) policy documents citing those publications (from any publishing organization).</p>
<p>This only scratches the surface of the possible applications of publications-policy documents linkage data, but hopefully it’ll give you a few basic tools to get started building your own application. Here are some ideas for customizing this notebook:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Change the GRID ID to another one you are more familiar with.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a different way to select publications: for example not using a research organization, but a category, a country, a funder or a combination of the many <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-publications.html">publication filters</a> available.</p></li>
</ul>
