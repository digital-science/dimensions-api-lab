<h1>Measuring the Innovation Impact of an Organization using Patents Citations<a class="headerlink" href="#Measuring-the-Innovation-Impact-of-an-Organization-using-Patents-Citations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This notebook shows how to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/">Dimensions Analytics API</a> to analyze the innovation impact of an organization.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two ways</strong> to achieve this. The <strong>first approach counts direct links</strong> between patents and the GRID organization we are interested in (i.e., it counts how many patents’ inventors are affiliated to the GRID organization). This method is faster to implement and can be easily achieved via a single <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-patents.html">patents API</a> query:</p>

[4] ARMOR PLATE (id: https://app.dimensions.ai/details/patent/WO-2011142867-A3 )
..etc..
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <strong>second method counts indirect links via publications</strong>, hence it permits to gain some insight into the <em>indirect</em> innovation impact of a research organization.</p>
<p>This is the method we’ll be focusing on, in this tutorial. The goal therefore is to extract and inspect patents that <strong>cite</strong> publications from the research organization in question.</p>
<p>Since the various content-types included in the Dimensions database are <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html">deeply interlinked</a>, the Dimensions APIs allow to perform this analysis via a few simple steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We start from a <a class="reference external" href="https://grid.ac/">GRID</a> identifier (representing a research organization in Dimensions)</p></li>
<li><p>We use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-publications.html">publications API</a> to extract all publications where at least one author is/as affiliated to the GRID organization, for a selected time-period</p></li>
<li><p>We then use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-patents.html">patents API</a> to discover patents that include citations to any of those publications</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we analyse the patents data to highlight trends e.g. about countries, inventors etc..</p></li>

<h2>2. Extracting Publications Data<a class="headerlink" href="#2.-Extracting-Publications-Data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By looking at the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/data-sources.html">Dimensions API data model</a>, we can see that Patents and Publications are connected by a property called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">publication_ids</span></code>, which goes <em>from</em> Patents <em>to</em> Publications. This property represents the publications citations found in patents.</p>
<p>Hence, we need to 1. query for all publications with authors affiliated to our GRID ID 2. query for patents citing these publications</p>

<h3>What are the main subject areas?<a class="headerlink" href="#What-are-the-main-subject-areas?" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We can use the Field of Research categories information in publications to obtain a breakdown of the publications by subject areas.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by ‘exploding’ the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">category_for</span></code> data into a separate table, since there can be more than one category per publication. The new categories table also retains some basic info about the publications it relates to eg <em>journal</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>publication id</em> etc.. so to make it easier to analyse the data.</p>

<p>Note: if the points on a scatterplot graph produce a lower-left-to-upper-right pattern (see below), that is indicative of a positive correlation between the two variables. This pattern means that when the score of one observation is high, we expect the score of the other observation to be high as well, and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here<a class="headerlink" href="#Where-to-go-from-here" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/">Dimensions Analytics API</a> tutorial we have seen how, starting from a GRID organization, it is possible to extract a) publications from authors associated to this organization, b) patents citing those publications (from any organization).</p>
<p>This only scratches the surface of the possible applications of publication-patents linkage data, but hopefully it’ll give you a few basic tools to get started building your own application. Here are some ideas for customizing this notebook:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Change the GRID ID to another one you are more familiar with</p></li>
<li><p>Use a different way to select publications: e.g. not using an organizations segment, but a category, a country, a funder or a combination of the many <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/datasource-publications.html">Publication filters</a> available</p></li>
<li><p>Do a more in-depth analysis of the patents inventors: do they have other publications linking to the publications they cite in patents? Are there patterns of collaborations with the institutions they cite?</p></li>
</ul>
