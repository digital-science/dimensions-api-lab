Welcome to the Dimensions API Lab!
==============================================

This site contains a collection of open source `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ showing how to carry out common research data analytics tasks using the `Dimensions Analytics API <https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-apis/>`_.

A companion `Github repository <https://github.com/digital-science/dimensions-api-lab>`_ including the source code for the notebooks is also available. The notebooks have been optimised so to work with `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/digital-science/dimensions-api-lab>`_ as well. 


.. important::
  The Dimensions Analytics API is not intended for bulk data or to power dashboards or other derivative products. The purpose of the API is to help support complex analytical tasks that could not otherwise be achieved through use of the Dimensions platform. For more information see also the page about `Reasonable Use <https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/usagepolicy.html>`_ 


.. note::
  The Dimensions Analytics API is **subscription-only**, so your Dimensions account needs to be activated for this service and is subject to restrictions on use. Please get in touch to discuss the best option for you how to get access. For one-off academic research projects we can also grant free access to our APIs. `Contact us <https://www.dimensions.ai/contact-us/>`_
